# typst-templates
Typst templates written as exercises to learn typst.

Currently tested against typst v.0.13.1.

## tufte-powerpoint v.0.0.1
A template which seeks to make it possible to emulate the typography of Edward R. Tufte's *The Cognitive Style of PowerPoint*. 

### Features provided
Currently none. The title of this project is aspirational. I started learning typst three days ago.

The following functions are planned but not yet implemented: 
- Outer margin references (`#sideref`)
- Outer margin notes (`#sidenote`)
- Outer margin figures (??) with optional captions
- With caption

- Starting initial paragraphs in a section with small caps
- Indenting 2-3 characters on subsequent paras
- Wide image, two panes, two captions
- Whole page image/table
- Adaptive outer margin width, to match width of figure in outer margin
- Wide images default to bottom of page.
